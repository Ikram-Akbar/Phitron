In C++, `null`, `NULL`, and `nullptr` are not exactly the same, but they are closely related and often used interchangeably. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

**1. `null` (not recommended):**

- This is not a valid keyword in C++. Using it might lead to compilation errors.
- It's likely a typo or a reference to languages like Java or C#, where `null` is a keyword for a null reference.

**2. `NULL` (macro):**

- Introduced in C (C++ inherited it).
- Defined in header files like `<cstddef>` or `<cstdlib>`.
- Typically expands to `(void*)0`, which is an integer literal zero cast to a void pointer.
- So, it essentially represents a null pointer value, but it's not type-safe.

**3. `nullptr` (keyword - introduced in C++11):**

- A proper keyword in C++11 and later.
- Represents a null pointer value of type `std::nullptr_t`.
- Type-safe, meaning it explicitly indicates a null pointer, avoiding potential ambiguities.
- Preferred over `NULL` in modern C++ for clarity and type safety.

**Here's a table summarizing the key points:**

| Term          | Type                 | Definition                                     | Recommendation |
|----------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `null`         | Not a valid keyword   | N/A                                              | **Do not use** |
| `NULL`         | Macro (preprocessor)  | Typically expands to `(void*)0`                  | **Discouraged** (use `nullptr` instead) |
| `nullptr`     | Keyword                | `std::nullptr_t` value                          | **Preferred**  |

**In essence:**

- Use `nullptr` for null pointers in modern C++.
- Avoid `null` as it's not a valid keyword.
- Consider migrating away from `NULL` for better type safety and clarity.

Remember, even though `NULL` and `nullptr` often have the same underlying value, `nullptr` is the recommended choice for its type safety and adherence to modern C++ practices.
